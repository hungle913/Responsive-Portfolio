          <p>Hello! My name is Hung Le. I am looking forward to learning how to code and do something more challenging for my career. I would like to be challeged everyday. I love to solve problems and create things. I've always been curious as to how apps are written and created. I believe this bootcamp will help me get to my final goal of app development. I am very eager to learn and be challenged everyday. </p>

          <p>I am very excited to learn how to code. It's been 17 years since I have been in school and this is proving to be very tough. But I am super pumped to learn as much as possible and do the best I can. I might be learning a lot slower then the rest of the class but I will not give up! Hoping this will be the start to a great new career that will challenge me and keep things exciting during my day to day work life.</p>

          <p>When I'm feeling stressed or just need a break from the world I love to go fishing. Being on the water is one of the most relaxing things. I can go fishing for hours on end. Catching fish is a bonus. Just being out on the water is the best.</p>
